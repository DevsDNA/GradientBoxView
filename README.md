# GradientBoxView

Add [DevsDNA.GradientBoxView](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DevsDNA.GradientBoxView) NuGet to both your PCL and platform projects and enjoy those beautiful gradients Designers like so much.

This control was inspired on [this Xamarin Forums thread](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/240777/#Comment_240777).

Pst! Have a look to the [Examples](Examples/) folder to get some inspiration!
